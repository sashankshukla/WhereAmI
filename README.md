# WhereAmI
Kurius Hacks project

Our website allows users to make their location available to us, in order for us to provide data and resources about the First Nations lands that they reside on. We have a blog section available to registered users, where they can share more facts and stories related to a specific indigenous location, which is publicly available once approved by a moderator. We also provide a responsive map, that gives you a pop-up with a wiki link of the First Nations region that you have clicked on.
